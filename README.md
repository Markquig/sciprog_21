# Scientific Programming Concepts PH502/ACM40660 Autumn 2021

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/ICHEC-learn/sciprog_21

The reprository contains a folder for each week, containing the practical for that week. 

For each program, the compile and run comands used on the sciprog server are included below the main function. 

## week_2/

This contains two files Conversion.c & Sum.c which are lightly eddited from those provided on brightspace.

## week_3/

This contians one file practical_3.c, which find the are under the curve tan(x) for x between 0 and pi.

## week_4/

This contians one file, practical_4.c, which finds the value of tan(x) for a range of values from 0 to 60&deg;.


## week_5/

This contians two program files. practical_5_fibonacci.c prints the first n fibocacci numbers, where n is provided during run time. practical_5_hyp_tan.c finds arctanh(x) via two different methods, and print the results for x in the interval [-0.9, 0.9] every 0.01. A delte must be provided during run time to determinc the accuracy of arctanh(x).

There are three files which hold the output of practical_5_hyp_tan.c for delta = {0.1, 0.01, 0.001}, they are hyp_tan_0_1.txt, hyp_tan_0_01.txt, & hyp_tan_0_001.txt respectivly. The file hyp_tan_Q5.txt contains the answer to one of the questions. 

## week_6/

This contians one file, practical_6.c, which multiplies a 5x3 matrix by a 3x4 matrix.

## week_7/

This contians one file, practical_7.c, which approximates the mathematical conctant e. It does the n times, where n is provided during run time, and prints the results. 


## week_8/

This contians one file, practical_8.c, which calculates the GCD of two numbers provided in the code, via two seporate functions and prints the results.

## week_9/

This contians one program file, main.c, which needs the header file magic_square.h to complie. Together they read in a square matrix from a file provided at exicution, and returns if it is a magic square.

The remaining files are example input files.

## week_10/
 
This contians one file, practical_10.c, which prints the steps required to solve the Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game. Additionaly, it runs through these steps and can print the recult.
