Looking at the last column (difference) in each of the tiles hyp_tan_0_*.txt we can see that as the delta provided reduces so to does the difference for each x[i] provided. The only x[i] that doesn't improve as delta is reduces is x[i]=0 as the answer is 0. Looking at the calculations just before and after x[I]=0 for delta = 0.01 or 0.001 there is no improvement for the smaller delta, simply because it it is so close to the correct answer. 
The last point of interest is that the further an x[i] is from 0, the less the two calculations agree. Taking delta = 0.1, the differences range from the first decimal place to the seventh (either side of x[i]=0). This reduction is partly due to the answers being smaller, but this only changes by thee order of magnitude over the same values.
